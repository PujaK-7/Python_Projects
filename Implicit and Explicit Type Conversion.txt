num=1+1.0
Result = 2.0

Python automatically converted the result in float type and gave 2.0.
This is implicit conversion as we did not have to ask it to convert to float.
This could be dangerous as it could give unexpected result.

num=1+int(1.0)
Result = 2

Here, we have explicitely converted the float value 1.0 into integer.

Developer should be careful in explicit conversion-
1. Converting float to int results in loss of decimal point value.
2. Large data type if conversted to smaller data type results in loss of data as numbers wil be truncated.
